# Stock Market Prediction Project

This project was done for my Programming for Data Science class in Stony Brook University with fellow student Kevin Lin. The project is detailed in the Stock_Market_Project Instructions.pdf file, which lays out the following instructions:

Given a list of daily signal and closing price values of the S&P500 (the list is the project_data.csv file), clean the data and use the signal to predict future stock closing prices.

The project is shown in the Stock Market Prediction Project.ipynb file, which is viewable through github. The project is done in two parts. The first part of the project is cleaning the data, and the using regression techniques to analyze the stock closing price based on the signal. The second part of the project is using time series analysis to predict the stock closing price.
